This is an end to end project done for the apps data that will be provided alongside the codes.
This apps data is in a csv file.
The main dot py is the main function where all the functions were called.
In the extract function, there is a parameter that takes in your file path, reads it, gives you
an information about your data and returns the data.

The first transform function takes an argument. In this function, the data were transformed
and cleaned. I dropped duplicated values. Some columns data types were changed. And the cleaned
data was equally returned.

The second transform takes 2 argument. This second transformation is only for the reviews columns
in the data. The 1st parameter is the data itself and the 2nd parameter takes
an input(integer) from the user also. The user has to input a review number greater
than 158. And the columns is already sorted out. The user only has to specify the number of
values they want using the head function
"DO NOT INPUT A STRING DATA TYPE"


Loading data
Next, we'd like to load the transformed dataset into  a SQL Database. We will be using pandas
and sqlite to do that.
In the load function. it takes in 3 parameters (database_name, dataframe, table_name)
The database_name and the table name can be any names that you want while the dataframe is the variable
name that you used in the transform_2 function in the main dot py
